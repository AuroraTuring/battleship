In your README reflect on the following:

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
- We started by writing the tests that we knew were necessary for the Game and Turn class, and implemented the methods to make those tests pass. Then, we wrote pseudocode for the entire game on our Google Docs, and implemented the code, writing unit tests as we progressed through the process. When the game was nearly complete, we did a bunch of refactoring and figured out what else we could break out into single-purpose methods. Finally, we wrote tests for those methods and wrote integration tests. Then, we added a little bit of pizzaz to enhance user experience.
