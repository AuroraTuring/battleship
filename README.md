1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
- We started by writing the tests that we knew were necessary for the Game and Turn class, and implemented the methods to make those tests pass. Then, we wrote pseudocode for the entire game on our Google Docs, and implemented the code, writing unit tests as we progressed through the process. When the game was nearly complete, we did a bunch of refactoring and figured out what else we could break out into single-purpose methods. Finally, we wrote tests for those methods and wrote integration tests. Then, we added a little bit of pizzaz to enhance user experience.

1. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
- We would probably refactor some more of our methods and write additional tests for the ones that were missing or skipped. 

1. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
- We ping ponged back and forth a lot in the beginning, then did screen sharing so I could follow along with code I didn't understand.

1. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
- We had a Google Doc we shared comments with each other on. We also directly commented on each others code from a pull request and responded there accordingly.
